ESRI-Arcmap-10.1-Data-Issue
===========================

I have recently come accross an issue while on ESRI Arcmap When I download my Mr SID base map from NJGIN my data collected from my Trimble GeoXT 2005 does not line up when layering the two data sets on top of each other. I have both layers in the same coordinate system and when I have both layers selected in the table of contients, I can see one of the layers but I cannot find the other layer, any advice to correct the data?
